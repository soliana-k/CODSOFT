During my internship at Codsoft, I completed a machine learning project focused on credit card fraud detection. I used a publicly available dataset from Kaggle and began by checking for missing values. After preprocessing, I split the data into training and testing sets. Due to significant class imbalance, I applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance the dataset. Finally, I trained a Random Forest Classifier to detect fraudulent transactions.
